1.
	a. fork()    - spawns a copy of the calling process
	b. exit()    - kills process and sends exit code to parent process
	c. getpid()  - return the process id of the calling program
	d. getppid() - returns the process id of the calling program's parent process
	e. wait()    - waits for a status change in the calling program's child process, default
			waits for child process to terminate
	f. execl()   - replaces the current program with another process

	Speed of Light = 299,792,458 m/s
   	75% Speed of Light = 299,792,458 * 0.75 = 224,844,343 m/s

	4GHz = 4,000,000,000 cycles per second	
	distance for one signal per 4GHz cycle = (75% Speed of Light / 4,000,000,000)/2 = 28mm

	12GHz = 12,000,000,000 cycles per second
	distance for one signal per 12GHz cycle = (75% Speed of Light / 12,000,000,000)/2 = 9mm
